# Product Roadmap

16 phases from architecture to production launch. Each phase has a concrete
deliverable and builds on the previous one.

| Phase | Name                        | Deliverable                                                                      | Status                                                                                       |

| 3     | Indian Legal Knowledge Base | Searchable, source-grounded legal repository (ingestion pipeline)                | ✅ Done (pipeline + storage; bulk corpus population is follow-up)                            |
| 4     | RAG Engine                  | Production Indian legal RAG (hybrid search + rerank + guardrails)                | ✅ Done (wired into chat; most answers are "insufficient evidence" until a corpus is loaded) |

## Phase 1 — what shipped

- Consumer: register, login, logout, email verification, password reset, profile
  (state, preferred language).
- Advocate: self-registration with practice areas/state/city/languages/fee/bio,
  own-profile view + edit, verification status.
- Admin: RBAC-gated user list/suspend and advocate verification queue
  (approve/reject) via `/api/v1/admin/*` — no dedicated UI yet, that's Phase 12.
  Bootstrap the first admin with `uv run python -m app.scripts.create_admin`.
- JWT access tokens + DB-backed, rotating refresh tokens (revocable — real
  logout). RBAC via `require_roles(...)` dependency.
- Frontend: `apps/web` has `/register /login /verify-email /reset-password
/profile`; `apps/advocate-portal` has `/register /login /profile`.

## Phase 2 — what shipped

- `POST /api/v1/chat/messages` — works anonymously (Tier 1 / public, per the
  FRD) or logged in. One Claude call classifies the message (legal category,
  jurisdiction scope, in/out of scope), a second generates the answer only if
  in scope; out-of-scope messages get a fixed reply without a second call.
- Conversations + messages persisted in Postgres (`conversations`,
  `chat_messages`); anonymous threads are addressable by ID, logged-in threads
  are also listable (`GET /chat/conversations`) and ownership-checked.
- **No retrieval grounding yet** — deliberately deferred to Phase 3
  (ingestion) / Phase 4 (RAG). The system prompt instructs the model to defer
  to an advocate rather than invent specifics, which is the closest honest
  stand-in until real sources exist; treat pre-Phase-4 answers as informational
  only, not citation-backed.
- Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (`apps/api/.env`) — unset by design until you
  add one; the endpoint 503s with a clear `llm_not_configured` error until then.
- Frontend: `apps/web` gets `/chat` — message thread, suggested questions
  (the FRD's example queries), new-conversation, and (when logged in) a
  history panel. Mandatory disclaimer shown on every page.

## Phase 3 — what shipped

- Ingestion pipeline (`apps/api/app/services/ingestion/`): fetch (HTTP, 25 MB
  cap) → extract (PDF via pypdf, HTML via BeautifulSoup) → clean (whitespace,
  page-number lines, Unicode noise) → chunk (size-based sliding window,
  ~1500 chars, 200 overlap) → embed (Gemini, free tier) → persist (pgvector,
  HNSW cosine index).
- `legal_documents` + `legal_chunks` tables track ingestion status
  (PENDING/PROCESSING/COMPLETED/FAILED) and the failure reason — one bad
  source never 500s the request.
- Admin API (`/api/v1/admin/legal-sources/*`, RBAC-gated): ingest, list,
  get, delete, re-index, and semantic search. No UI yet — that's Phase 12;
  usable now via `/docs`.
- Requires `GEMINI_API_KEY` (`apps/api/.env`) — unset by design, same
  "build now, key later" pattern as Phase 2; ingestion records a FAILED
  status with `embeddings_not_configured` until you add one.
- **`section`/`article` metadata is not populated** — an early attempt at
  heading-detection proved unreliable against real PDF-extracted text and
  was dropped; see
  [`docs/adr/0006-chunking-strategy.md`](adr/0006-chunking-strategy.md).
- **No documents are pre-loaded.** The roadmap's "initial knowledge base"
  (IT Act, DPDP Act, Companies Act, etc.) is a bulk-ingestion follow-up, not
  done in this pass — the pipeline was validated by actually fetching and
  processing the real IT Act 2000 and DPDP Act 2023 PDFs during development
  (that's also how the chunking bug in the ADR above was found), not by
  populating the repository.
- Chat (Phase 2) is **not yet wired to this** — that integration (hybrid
  search, reranking, cited answers) is Phase 4.

## Phase 4 — what shipped

- Hybrid retrieval (`apps/api/app/services/rag/retrieval.py::hybrid_search`):
  pgvector cosine similarity + Postgres full-text search (a generated
  `tsvector` column, GIN-indexed — migration 0005) over `legal_chunks`,
  fused with Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) rather than a paid/ML reranker —
  see [`docs/adr/0007-hybrid-search-and-grounding.md`](adr/0007-hybrid-search-and-grounding.md)
  for why, including the no-paid-services constraint.
- `POST /api/v1/chat/messages` now runs retrieval for in-scope questions and
  answers only from what it finds (`llm.py::generate_grounded_answer`),
  citing sources with `[n]` markers. Citations are also persisted on the
  assistant `ChatMessage` (`sources` JSONB — document, section/article,
  source URL) and rendered as a source list in `apps/web`'s chat UI.
- **Guardrail**: retrieval returning nothing — empty corpus, an unrelated
  question, or `GEMINI_API_KEY` unset — short-circuits to
  `INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE_MESSAGE` without a second Claude call, rather than
  guessing. A hard cosine-distance threshold was considered and rejected:
  there's no real corpus yet to calibrate one against.
- **Chat now needs both API keys** to produce a grounded answer:
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (unchanged from Phase 2) and `GEMINI_API_KEY` (new —
  same key Phase 3's ingestion uses). Missing `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` still 503s;
  missing `GEMINI_API_KEY` degrades to the insufficient-evidence reply
  instead, since that failure mode is indistinguishable from "no sources
  matched" on the user's side.
- **Still no bulk corpus loaded** (carried over from Phase 3) — so in the
  platform's current state, hybrid search returns nothing for essentially
  every query and almost all chat answers are correctly
  "insufficient evidence". This is the honest behavior of an empty knowledge
  base, not a regression; verified end-to-end by
  `test_hybrid_search_returns_empty_list_when_no_chunks_exist` and
  `test_insufficient_evidence_short_circuits_generation`.
- The Phase 3 admin debug endpoint (`GET /admin/legal-sources/search`,
  plain vector search) is unchanged — kept deliberately separate from the
  chat pipeline's hybrid search so an admin can inspect raw embedding
  similarity without RRF re-ordering muddying the signal.

## Phase 5 — what shipped

- `risk_level` (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/CRITICAL) is now a fourth field on the same
  forced-tool-call classification Phase 2 already made — not a second Claude
  call. See [`docs/adr/0008-risk-scoring.md`](adr/0008-risk-scoring.md) for
  why (cost, and two independent judgements of the same message risking
  disagreement).
- Classification moved out of `llm.py` into its own module
  (`apps/api/app/services/legal_classifier.py`) — completing the split
  `llm.py`'s Phase 2/4 docstrings had already flagged as coming. A new
  `risk_engine.py` holds the pure decision logic
  (`requires_advocate_recommendation`), separate from how the risk level was
  produced.
- HIGH/CRITICAL messages get `ADVOCATE_RECOMMENDATION_MESSAGE` appended to
  the assistant reply — whether it's a grounded answer or an
  insufficient-evidence one; out-of-scope replies are unaffected (they're not
  assessing legal risk at all).
- `chat_messages.risk_level` (migration 0006, indexed) persists the level
  alongside the existing `legal_category`/`jurisdiction_scope` columns, ready
  for the Phase 12 admin "high-risk query review" queue.
- No new API keys or settings — risk scoring rides on the same
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` classification call Phase 2 already required.

## Phase 6 — what shipped

- `GET /api/v1/documents/types` — all 11 document types from
  `packages/shared/src/legal.ts::DOCUMENT_TYPES` (Rental Agreement,
  Employment Agreement, NDA, Affidavit, Declaration, Business Agreement,
  Partnership Document, Authorization Letter, Service Agreement, Legal
  Notice, Other), each with a fixed questionnaire
  (`apps/api/app/services/document_assistant/questions.py`) — matches the
  FRD §7 worked example, every set asks for the Indian state (FRD §12).
- `POST /api/v1/documents` — validates the answers against that type's
  required questions (422 with per-field details if any are missing), then
  one Claude call (`document_assistant/generation.py::generate_draft`)
  produces a labeled DRAFT plus a Notes section (what's normally required,
  common clauses, likely supporting documents, what professional
  verification may be required) and persists it. Works anonymously or
  logged in, same as chat.
- **Not RAG-grounded** — no `hybrid_search` call, no citations. This was a
  deliberate scope decision, not an oversight:
  see [`docs/adr/0009-document-assistant-scope.md`](adr/0009-document-assistant-scope.md).
  Safety comes from the prompt (state-variance + professional-verification
  language, DRAFT-only framing, no invented facts) and the standard
  `MANDATORY_DISCLAIMER`, not citations.
- **Failed generations aren't persisted** — unlike ingestion's
  `ingestion_status=FAILED` rows, a Claude failure here 503s the request
  directly (same pattern as chat); every `document_requests` row is a
  successfully generated draft (docs/adr/0009).
- `GET /documents` (your own requests) / `GET /documents/{id}`
  (ownership-checked, readable anonymously if it has no owner) — same shape
  as chat's conversation endpoints.
- Requires `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` only — no new API key, no `GEMINI_API_KEY`
  dependency, since there's no retrieval step.
- Frontend: `apps/web` gets `/documents` — pick a type, fill the
  questionnaire, get the draft.

## Phase 7 — what shipped

- `GET /api/v1/advocates` — public directory search over `AdvocateProfile`
  (built in Phase 1), filterable by `practice_area`, `state_code`, `city`,
  `language`, `min_experience_years`, `max_consultation_fee`; paginated,
  ordered most-experienced-first. Only ever returns `VERIFIED` advocates —
  pending/rejected profiles are excluded, not just hidden.
- `GET /api/v1/advocates/{id}` — single verified advocate's public profile.
  Same 404 whether the id doesn't exist or exists but isn't verified, so an
  unverified advocate's profile isn't discoverable even by guessing its id.
- Public responses (`AdvocateDirectoryEntry`) are a narrower shape than the
  advocate's own `AdvocateProfileOut`: adds `display_name` (joined from
  `User`, not a column on the profile itself) and omits
  `verification_note` (an internal admin moderation note).
- **Two FRD §8 filters aren't implemented**: "consultation type" and
  ratings/reviews. Neither exists as real data yet — both only make sense
  once Phase 8 introduces actual consultations (a type to declare, a
  completed matter to review) — so they weren't faked with placeholder
  fields.
- No schema changes — Phase 1's `advocate_profiles` table already had every
  field this phase needed (`practice_areas`, `state_code`, `city`,
  `languages`, `consultation_fee`, `experience_years`, `availability`,
  `verification_status`).
- Frontend: `apps/web` gets `/advocates` (filterable search) and
  `/advocates/[id]` (profile view) — read-only; booking a consultation is
  Phase 8, so the profile page says so rather than showing a dead button.

## Upgrade — free providers, streaming, design system (2026-09-27)

- **Free-only AI stack**: provider layer (`app/services/llm_provider.py`)
  with Gemini (default, same free key as embeddings), Groq, Ollama and
  optional Anthropic — [ADR 0010](adr/0010-free-llm-providers-and-streaming.md),
  [API inventory](api-inventory.md).
- **Knowledge-base seeding**: catalogue of 15 official Acts
  (`official_sources.py`) + `pnpm kb:seed`.
- **Streaming chat** (`POST /chat/messages/stream`, SSE) with stop/retry.
- **`GET /api/v1/status`**: real provider/corpus/directory availability for
  the UI (no placeholders).
- **Quota protection**: per-client rate limit on AI endpoints, query-embedding
  cache, 429 backoff for ingestion.
- **UI**: shared dark glass design system across both apps; responsive and
  keyboard/screen-reader friendly; skeleton, empty and error states.
- **Fixes**: `message_role` enum persisted names instead of values (chat
  inserts failed on Postgres); web client's 10s timeout aborted normal
  AI requests; test-suite event-loop leak.

## Dynamic source discovery (2026-10-03)

- `legal_source_catalog` + pluggable providers replace the hand-typed
  source list: `curated` (the original 15), `india_code_oai` (India Code's
  DSpace OAI-PMH feed) and `hf_dataset` (~34.7k central + state Act PDFs).
  Admin UI at `/admin/knowledge`; `pnpm kb:discover[:ingest]`.
  [ADR 0011](adr/0011-dynamic-source-discovery.md).

## Phases 8–14 — what shipped (2026-10-03)

- **8 Consultation booking** — `consultations` table and lifecycle
  (`consultation_lifecycle.py`); booking form on advocate profiles, consumer
  `/consultations`, advocate accept/decline/complete/close.
- **9 Advocate dashboard** — live request counts on the portal home.
- **10 Payments** — Razorpay orders, checkout + webhook signature
  verification, admin refunds, per-attempt `payments` rows, "Pay" button.
  [ADR 0012](adr/0012-payments-provider.md).
- **11 Notifications** — `notifications` table, bell + feed in both apps,
  SMTP delivery. [ADR 0013](adr/0013-notifications.md).
- **12 Admin console** — `/admin` in the web app: overview, verification,
  high-risk review (with reviewed state), knowledge base, payments, users,
  audit log.
- **13 Security** — SSRF guard, auth throttling, production config guard,
  security headers, audit trail, prompt fencing.
  [ADR 0014](adr/0014-security-hardening.md).
- **14 Testing** — Playwright journey across all three apps (`pnpm e2e`,
  CI job `e2e`), frontend unit tests, and `alembic check` fixed.
- **15/16** — launch runbook in `infrastructure/deployment/README.md`.

Per-feature status and what's left: [project-status.md](project-status.md).

## MVP scope (Phase 16)

Consumer Legal Chat · Legal Document Assistant · Advocate Search · Consultation
Booking. Payments, video consultation, premium subscription, enterprise assistant
and advanced compliance follow progressively.

## Non-negotiable product rules

- **Grounded, not guessed.** Answers come from retrieved verified Indian legal
  sources. Insufficient evidence → say so, don't invent. No fabricated citations.
- **Information, not representation.** The AI never claims to be an advocate or to
  create an advocate-client relationship. High-risk matters route to an advocate.
- **Jurisdiction-aware.** Distinguish central vs state vs local; never quote a
  single national figure for state-varying things (e.g. stamp duty).
- **Disclaimer always visible** wherever AI legal information is shown
  (`@legal-platform/shared` → `MANDATORY_DISCLAIMER`).
- The professional-services / payment model must be reviewed against applicable
  Indian legal and professional rules before commercial launch.
