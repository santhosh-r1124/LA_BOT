"""Email sending abstraction.

The Phase 1 default logs the email (including the actionable link) via
structlog instead of sending anything — no SMTP/provider account is needed to
develop or test the auth flows locally. ``services/notifications`` (Phase 11)
is where a real provider (SES/Postmark/etc.) gets wired in behind this same
``EmailSender`` protocol.
